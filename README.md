## 📝 Ultimate Guide to the 8th Pay Commission

As the Indian government moves closer to the implementation of the **8th Pay Commission**, millions of central government employees and pensioners are looking for clarity. With inflation rising, the 8th CPC is expected to provide much-needed financial relief and a significant jump in the basic pay structure.

### What is the 8th Pay Commission?
The Pay Commission is a specialized body set up by the Government of India to review and recommend changes to the salary structure, allowances, and benefits for its employees. Traditionally, these commissions are established every 10 years. With the 7th CPC ending its cycle, the 8th Pay Commission is the next big milestone for the Indian workforce to ensure wages keep pace with inflation and the cost of living.

## 🧮 How to Calculate Your New Salary
Calculating the 8th Pay Commission salary involves a specific mathematical logic. Our tool automates this for you using the following steps:

1.  **Identify Current Basic:** Locate your 7th CPC basic pay (as of late 2025).
2.  **Select Fitment Factor:** Choose the projected multiplier (e.g., 2.86).
3.  **Apply the Formula:** $$\text{New Basic Pay} = \text{Current Basic Pay} \times \text{Expected Fitment Factor}$$
4.  **Add Allowances:** Once the new basic is calculated, the tool adds revised DA (reset to 0% initially) and updated HRA percentages.
